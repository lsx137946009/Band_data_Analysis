# Band_data_Analysis
### Works of this project
1. This project is aim to compare the precision of heart rate of two bands.
2. In the project, we parse the data of SensOmics Band firstly.
3. We use Mse and Correlation coefficient as the indicator for comparing.
4. We show the results with various forms of pictures.
